# Welcome :boat:
Iceberg ASV is a student-led, inter-disciplinary engineering competition team representing Memorial University at the annual International RoboBoat Competition in Florida. Our team works collaboratively to design, construct, and test an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV). 

# GitHub Structure
The GitHub Structure of our organization includes a 'main' repository, [asv](https://github.com/IcebergASV/asv) which encapsulates and integrates all software used on our boat. There exists sub-modules of the [asv-system] for each hardware component, such as [asv-lidar] and [asv-camera]. 

There is also a repo, [gz-simulator] that contains all software and resources used in our GAZEBO simulation environment.
